A Looper/Beat sampler created in Racket as part of Cal Poly's CPE 123: Introduction to Computing (Music) class. 

Allows users to play sounds, record them in a loop, and save the loop. The loop may also be loaded as yet another sound that may be played.
Sounds may be dynamically added to a loop already playing by simply recording over the loop already in the queue.

**Files**:

LooperClean.rkt — the main racket program file, runs everything for the program.  
put-file.rkt — racket file for reading the loop files  
get-file.rkt — racket file for loading the loop files  

images — all the images required for the GUI, with the hit ones being the ones for when keys are hit.

---

**Keys not on GUI**:

a-j — synth notes  
e — allows loading of .wav sounds into the program  
q — key that the loaded sounds from e are mapped to, use this to play that sound  
return/enter — mutes the program
