A Looper/Beat sampler created in Racket. 

Allows users to play sounds, record them in a loop, and save the loop. The loop may also be loaded as yet another sound that may be played.

LooperClean.rkt — the main racket program file, runs everything for the program.
put-file.rkt — racket file for reading the loop files
get-file.rkt — racket file for loading the loop files

images — all the images required for the GUI, with the hit ones being the ones for when keys are hit.

——————————————————————

Keys not on GUI:
a-j — synth notes
e — allows loading of wav sounds into the program
q — key that the loaded sounds from e are mapped to, use this to play that sound
return/enter — mutes the program
